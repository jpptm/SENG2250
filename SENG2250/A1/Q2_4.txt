---- ---- Q2 ---- ----
Suppose that a language “X” has 28 different letters. Answer the following questions.

a. Alice wants to use a 10-letter password (case insensitive). Each password character is 
randomly  selected  from  28  possible  letters.  How  many  different  passwords  can  be  
generated?        (5 marks) 





b. Suppose that an adversary can attempt passwords at a rate of four million per second. 
If an adversary can immediately know an attempted password’s correctness, what is 
the  expected  time (i.e., average time) to  reveal  Alice’s  password  generated  above? 
Convert the time to the number of seconds.    (8 marks) 





c. Suppose that Bob uses a monoalphabetic substitution cipher (regarding the language 
“X”) to encrypt a message.  Assume the redundancy of the plaintext “X” is 4.5. How 
many ciphertext characters are needed to identify a unique key?  (12 marks)

4. Hash Functions (20 marks)

a. Let ℎ be a secure one-way hash function. Given a set {𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑣3, 𝑣4, 𝑣5}, such that 
𝑣1  = ℎ(𝑥);   𝑣2  = ℎ(𝑣1);   𝑣3  = ℎ(𝑣2);   𝑣4  = ℎ(𝑣3);   𝑣5  = ℎ(𝑣4). 
Suppose 𝑣3 is  known,  can  we  compute  any  of  the  others  in {𝑣1, 𝑣2, 𝑣4, 𝑣5}?  If  yes,  
show how; otherwise, explain why.      (10 marks) 
 



b. Let (𝑒, 𝑛) be  an  RSA  public  key,  and  (𝑝, 𝑞, 𝑑) be  the  corresponding  private  key.  The  
public key (𝑒, 𝑛) is known to everyone, but NO ONE knows the private key (𝑝, 𝑞, 𝑑). 




Consider a message 𝑚

function? Justify your answer      (5 marks) 





2) If 𝑚> 𝑛, can we use the RSA encryption algorithm as a cryptographic hash 
function? Justify your answer.
